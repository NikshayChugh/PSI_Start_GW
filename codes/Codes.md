In this folder, we maintain
1. Python Scripts
2. Slurm Scripts
3. Jupyter Notebooks

The Python and Slurm scripts go together.

Jupyter Notebooks are messed up and require some cleaning. They contain a lot of brainstorming and may be difficult to navigate. The core functionalities of generating the catalogs and computing the bias are well developed in the Python scripts.
