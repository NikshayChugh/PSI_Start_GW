This directory contains the most messed up and perhaps the second most important stuff of all. 

hi.ipynb was used majorly to work on the gw bias analysis. It contains everything from poking into dataframes, fine-tuning the plots, and writing simple test for unobvious cases. 
hello.ipynb was used for several intermediate purposes, such as determinging the structure and contents of the dataframes generated during processing.
powerspectrum.ipynb and the other ps jupyter notebook deal with PyPower and classes defined to compute the power spectrum using them. Some classes are well constructed but unneccesary for our purposes. These may be useful for other researchers :)

If you look carefully enough you may find all possible mistakes one can make (o_O)
