>We used `Pylians` to compute the CIC-density fields in the final part of the project. Earlier developments are shared here.

>[!TIP]
>`cic_comparison_tool.py ` may be used to compare fields that are obtained from different algorithms of CIC-density assignment. We observed, as you may check in the logs, that for different users, different chunk files of snapshots were missing for each download session which results in minor changes in the final field. The difference is usually not much and within tolerance.
