# PSI_Start_GW
This repository is a collection of code Taissia Karasova and me used during summer 2025 to:
1. Compute the Power Spectrum of Galaxies, Dark Matter, and other objects if their field is specified.
2. Generate Mock Siren Catalogs on the Illustris TNG300-1 simulation data, using a broken power law.
3. Use these catalogs to compute the gravitational wave bias for our model.
4. Analyse the obtained data and draw conclusions.

Most of the code in the siren catalog generation is due to Dorsa Sadat Hossein. 

This project was supervised by Prof Ghazal Geshnizjani at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. 
We thank the PSI Start Program for funding and support.
