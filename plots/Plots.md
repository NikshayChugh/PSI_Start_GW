This folder contains relevant plots.

Bias is approximated as b(k) = b_0 + b_1 * k = np.sqrt(P_siren/P_dm)

Minimization of the chi^2 over the range of k = 0.04 to k = 1 leads to best-fit values of b_0 and b_1. 

Plots in this folder are for the best-fit bias computed at k = 0.1 h/Mpc. [ b(k=0.1) = b_0 + 0.1 * b_1 where b_0 and b_1 are the best-fits]
